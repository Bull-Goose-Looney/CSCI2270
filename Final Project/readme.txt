To whom it may concern,

At the time of submitting, my code compiles and runs.
Most of the functionallity outlined within my proposal is
working, but there are a lot of bugs and some functionalities have not been implemented or tested. I
used a Hash table to store parts. The hash table is an
object thats used by a shop node. Each shop is part of a graph. There is supposed to be distance weighted Edges, but
I ran out of time. I am happy to say that the hash table for
the main shop seems to be working well.

I used g++ in a linux gnome terminal.
The only command line argument is "masterParts.csv" (So Far).
